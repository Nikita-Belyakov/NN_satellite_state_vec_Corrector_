## TLE-to-state vector SGP4 model corrector via neural network according ILRS cpf predictions
## ABOUT:
The project is dedicated to the problem of improving accuracy satellite's state vector evaluation from TLE (two-line-element) parameters. There are several models such as SGP4 and SGP8, available to determine satellite's state vector [x,y,z] from TLE with some errors up to 500 m that maybe to significant in some critical cases for spacecraft's safety.
ILRS data from ground stations provide very accurate state vectors evaluation with negligible error up to several cm. The main problem is that these data can be avaluated only for several satellites and during visible time zones for ground stations. In that case TLE date is more universal and stable, as it's regularly generated for each active satellite with norad id.
Our approach consisits of making SGP4 model more accurate using ILRS state vectors on the same timestamps as the gt (ground truth) coordinates [x,y,z] for the spacecraft. As the CRS (coordinate reference system) we use all calculations on J2000 as one of hte most universal inertial (fixed) CRSs.
We compare the rusults of the classic ML models corrections to SGP4 model such as Random Forest etc. with neural networks (MLP with several hidden layers) results to find the most siutable architecture for such roblem of SGP correction according ILRS gt data.
